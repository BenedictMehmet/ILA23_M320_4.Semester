       Create a simple C# program that demonstrates polymorphism using interfaces.
       Define an interface IPayment with a method ProcessPayment.
       Then, create two classes CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment
       that implement this interface and provide their own implementations for the ProcessPayment method.
       Use polymorphism to call the ProcessPayment method on instances of both classes.

       Alert!

       The result of execution should be:

       "Processing credit card payment" "Processing PayPal payment"



       2.

       Create a C# program that demonstrates Constructor Injection,
       Setter Injection, and Interface Injection.
       Implement a simple service ILoggingService and a class MyClass that depends on this service.
       Demonstrate each type of dependency injection method.

       Alert!

       The result of execution should be:

       Constructor Injection: Logging message.
       Setter Injection: Logging message.
       Interface Injection: Logging message.

       Please, avoid changing the given source code for the exercise! So only add code, don't modify unless it is instructed to do so!

       Create a simple C# program that demonstrates polymorphism using interfaces. The program should:

       Declare an interface IShape with a method double GetArea().

       Create two classes, Circle and Rectangle, that implement the IShape interface.

       The Circle class should have a constructor that takes a radius and implements the GetArea method to return the area of the circle.

       The Rectangle class should have a constructor that takes width and height, and implements the GetArea method to return the area of the rectangle.

       In the PrintAreas method, create an array of IShape containing instances of Circle and Rectangle, and print the area of each shape to the console.

       Alert!

       The result of execution should be the area of each shape printed to the console.

       Example:

       For a Circle with radius 5 and a Rectangle with width 4 and height 6, the output should be:

       Area: 78.53981633974483\nArea: 24\n
